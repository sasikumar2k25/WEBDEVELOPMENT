<h2><EM>INTRODUCTION ABOUT MY JOURNEY</EM></h2>
<p><i>Hello! I am currently a 2nd-year B.Tech student at PBRVITS College,located in Kavali, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh.Specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) . With a keen interest in technology and programming, I have started my journey into learning various programming languages such as Python, HTML, and C from #MENTIBY  . These skills are helping me bridge my knowledge of both hardware and software, which is essential in the field of electronics and communication. so,for that I have developed a strong interest in programming and have begun learning languages such as Python, HTML, and C.

    My ultimate goal is to not only enhance my programming skills but also focus on building practical projects that solve real problems. I am particularly interested in collaborating with companies to gain hands-on experience.
    
    I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate, learn, and grow both individually and with industry professionals in the field of technology.</i></p>
